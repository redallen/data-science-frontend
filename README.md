# access-requests-frontend

This package is the source for TAM tool for Red Hatters to request access to accounts in order to debug their data. Designs can be found [here.](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/257je526/screens)

Since most components are only slightly tweaked between the requester (aka internal) and approver (aka external) views an `isInternal` flag is passed around to control visibility.

The list and details pages are exported as federated modules for use in [rbac-ui.](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-rbac-ui)
